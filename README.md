- The TwitterAuthenticator class inherits the OAuthHandler class and passes in the credentials to allow access to Twitterâ€™s API features.
- The TwitterClient class contains all the methods to interact with Twitter API and parsing tweets. Use __init__ function to handle the authentication of API client.
- Create a object of class TwitterClient() and use the objetc to get twitter client api using get_twitter_client_api() function.
- create a window using tkinter and let the user input the hashtag.
- Use api to search for the tweets of inputted hastag and store the tweets.
- Extract the labels and sentences and store the outcomes in y and after preprocessing the tweets store them in x.
- Then used count Vectorizer to lowercases text,performed tokenization (converts raw text to smaller units of text),used word level tokenization (meaning each word is treated as a separate token),ignored single characters during tokenization.
- Now one iterate the tweets and one by one preprocess and transform the tweets and do predictions.
